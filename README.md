# StochasticRainfallModel_Orography
Non-stationary trans-Gaussian geostatistical model designed for modeling and mapping daily rainfall over complex topography
[Code written in Matlab]

As a preliminary step unZip the files BI_MONTHLY_2018-2020.zip, Partial_Filled_Daily_RF_mm.zip and Preprocess_Paper_Reproducibility.zip

Then open and run main.m

All equations and algorithms are detailed in the paper "A non-stationary trans-Gaussian model for daily rainfall over complex topography" to be submitted in HESS.
